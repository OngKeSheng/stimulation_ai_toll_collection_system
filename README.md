🛣️ AI-Powered Toll Collection System
An intelligent toll collection system designed to automate vehicle classification at toll booths using computer vision and AI. This lightweight and efficient model identifies vehicle types (e.g., car, van, truck) through image analysis — eliminating the need for manual classification by toll booth staff.

🚀 Features
🤖 AI-based Vehicle Classification: Uses machine learning to accurately detect and categorize vehicles from live camera feeds.

📷 Camera Integration: Captures real-time images for processing without relying on License Plate Recognition (LPR).

💻 Laptop-Friendly: Designed to run efficiently on standard laptops, making it ideal for deployment in small-scale or mobile toll setups.

🔍 Modular Design: Easy to integrate with existing toll collection systems or expand with additional modules like payment or logging.

🧠 Simplified Model: Focused on vehicle type detection only — keeping the system streamlined and fast.

🧩 Modules
Image Capture Module – Captures frames from connected cameras.

Vehicle Detection Module – Processes images to classify vehicle types.

User Interface (Optional) – Displays classification results or integrates with barrier control systems.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)

Webcam or IP camera for image input

Lightweight ML model for classification
